    * Modified file structure in react app (put page components in sub-folders and moved page-layouts folder to src).
    * Added 'style.css' files to each page folder for local styling of a given page
    * Added 'providers' folder in src, with 'ThemeProvider.jsx' context component
    * Added 'themes' folder in src, containing css files for custom theme data
    * Added 'assets' folder in src, containing all potential assets we may need (including images, audio, video, etc)
